# drawing drawing
A class at SFPC Fall 2019

Teacher: Taeyoon Choi 

5 Sessions, 3 hour classes 

drawing drawing is a class about visual storytelling and the joy of drawing. The class is inspired by Shantell Martin's class "[Drawing on Everything](https://itp.nyu.edu/classes/doe-spring2014/files/2014/02/DRAWING-ON-EVERYTHING-WITH-SHANTELL-MARTIN-SPRING-2014-ITP.pdf)." Drawing is a fundamental human act of mark making. How can we take drawing to the next level? Can we introduce the concept of time and space into drawing? Can we tell stories by drawing? Can we perform drawing?
